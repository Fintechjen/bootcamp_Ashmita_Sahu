# Finance A/B Test with Linear Regression

This project evaluates whether a redesigned financial education module causes an increase in usersâ€™ savings behavior compared to the current module. We will run an A/B test (control vs treatment) and estimate the treatment effect with linear regression while controlling for baseline activity and demographics. The primary stakeholder is the product team improving engagement and retention; end users are app customers who benefit from clearer guidance and nudges. The main outputs are a causal effect estimate (with CIs), simple predictive checks, and an implementation decision recommendation.
